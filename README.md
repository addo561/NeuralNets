# Neural Networks from Scratch

This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Neural Network** from scratch using Python. The goal of this project is to create a simple neural network model that learns from data through training, adjusts its weights and biases, and improves its predictions over time.

## Overview

A **Neural Network** is a computational model inspired by the human brain, designed to recognize patterns in data. It consists of layers of **neurons** (also known as nodes), where each neuron processes input data, performs a computation, and passes the result to the next layer. The network is trained using an algorithm called **backpropagation**, which helps adjust the model's weights to minimize errors in predictions.

### Key Components of a Neural Network:
- **Neurons**: Basic units that perform computations and pass data to other neurons in the network.
- **Layers**: Neural networks are typically composed of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer.
- **Weights**: Parameters that determine the strength of connections between neurons.
- **Biases**: Parameters that allow the network to shift the output of neurons, helping to improve learning.
- **Activation Function**: A mathematical function applied to the output of each neuron to introduce non-linearity, enabling the network to learn complex relationships (e.g., Sigmoid, ReLU).
- **Loss Function**: A function used to measure the difference between the networkâ€™s prediction and the actual value, guiding the optimization process.
- **Backpropagation**: The process of adjusting the weights and biases based on the gradient of the loss function to reduce prediction error.

## Project Structure

The neural network implementation follows these basic steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Input data is prepared and normalized as necessary.
2. **Forward Propagation**: Data flows through the network, with each layer applying its weights, biases, and activation functions to produce an output.
3. **Loss Calculation**: The output of the network is compared to the expected result, and a loss is computed.
4. **Backpropagation**: The gradients of the loss with respect to the weights and biases are calculated, and the parameters are updated using optimization algorithms (e.g., gradient descent).
5. **Training**: The process of repeatedly adjusting the weights and biases over multiple epochs to minimize the loss.
6. **Prediction**: Once trained, the neural network is used to make predictions on new data.

## Dependencies

- **NumPy**: A library for handling numerical operations efficiently, such as matrix multiplication and element-wise operations.

You can install NumPy using:

```bash
pip install numpy
```

## How the Neural Network Works

### 1. **Forward Propagation**
In forward propagation, the input data passes through each layer of the neural network. Each neuron in a layer computes a weighted sum of its inputs, adds a bias, and applies an activation function to generate its output. The output of each layer is used as input to the next layer, eventually leading to the final prediction.

### 2. **Loss Function**
The loss function quantifies how far the network's prediction is from the actual target. The goal of training is to minimize this loss. Popular loss functions include:
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** for regression tasks.
- **Cross-Entropy Loss** for classification tasks.

### 3. **Backpropagation**
Backpropagation is used to update the weights and biases. It involves calculating the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight and bias and then adjusting them using an optimization algorithm (like gradient descent). This process ensures that the network learns by reducing the prediction error iteratively.

### 4. **Training**
The training process involves repeatedly performing forward propagation, calculating the loss, and applying backpropagation to update the weights and biases. This process is repeated over multiple **epochs** (iterations), with the network gradually improving its ability to make accurate predictions.

### 5. **Prediction**
After the network has been trained, it can be used to make predictions. Input data is passed through the network, and the final output layer produces a predicted value.

## How to Run the Neural Network

To train and use the neural network:

1. **Prepare the dataset**: Organize your input data (features) and output labels (targets).
2. **Initialize the network**: Specify the number of input features, the number of neurons in hidden layers, and the number of output neurons.
3. **Train the network**: Pass your data through the network, calculate the loss, perform backpropagation, and update the weights iteratively.
4. **Make predictions**: After training, the network can be used to predict outcomes on new data.

## Use Cases

- **Classification**: A neural network can be trained to classify data into categories, such as image recognition or spam detection.
- **Regression**: Neural networks can predict continuous values, such as stock prices or house prices.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Neural networks can be trained to recognize patterns and identify anomalies in data.

## Hyperparameters

- **Learning Rate**: The learning rate controls how much the weights are adjusted during each update. A high learning rate may cause overshooting of the optimal solution, while a low learning rate can result in slow convergence.
- **Epochs**: The number of iterations for training the network. Each epoch involves one pass through the entire training dataset.
- **Batch Size**: The number of training examples used in one iteration before updating the weights. Smaller batch sizes may lead to more frequent updates, while larger batch sizes can speed up the training process.

## Conclusion

This project provides a simple, yet effective, implementation of a neural network from scratch. It demonstrates how neural networks work and the fundamental principles of training such a model. While this implementation is basic, it can be extended and improved for more complex tasks, such as multi-layer networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), or recurrent neural networks (RNNs).
